This project is one of the assignments that I did when I followed along Stanford's iOS programming class online in the summer.

This game implements a matching game iPhone app that lets the user select cards, and gives points or deducts points based on whether or not the cards match.

The main game, Matchismo, is fully implemented. As practice with using multiple view/view controllers, another game, "Set", is also included. However, the current game of Set is left as is and is not a full game yet.
